    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This baked jerk chicken is not too sweet, not too spicy. I was on the hunt
      for a perfect jerk seasoning and ended up making my own blend. Hope you
      like it!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dried minced garlic</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon dried thyme leaves</li>
      <li>1 (2 to 3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
      <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix salt, allspice, brown sugar, onion powder, garlic, nutmeg, black
        pepper, ginger, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, and thyme in a large bowl; add
        chicken pieces and toss to coat with seasoning mix. Cover and marinate
        in the refrigerator, 2 to 4 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour vegetable oil
        into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken pieces skin-side up into the baking dish. Bake in the
        preheated oven until juices run clear and chicken is no longer pink near
        the bone, 1 hour 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near
        the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the oven on to broil, and cook until the skin crisps, 2 to 5
        minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
