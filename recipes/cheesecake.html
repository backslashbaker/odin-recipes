    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      When you just don't have the energy to mess about with baking, an easy
      cheesecake is a make-ahead wonder. You can swap in all kinds of toppings
      for this cheesecake - fresh berries, chocolate biscuits, a shop-bought
      fruit compote, or other chopped up chocolate bars.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>200g/7oz digestive biscuits</li>
      <li>75g/2½ oz unsalted butter</li>
      <li>400g/14oz full-fat cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
      <li>300g/10½ oz mascarpone, at room temperature</li>
      <li>200g/7oz icing sugar, sifted</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>100g/3½oz malted milk balls (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the digestive biscuits into a sealable freezer bag. Push all the
        air out and seal the bag. Crush the biscuits with a rolling pin, being
        careful not to break any holes in the bag.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt the butter in a large saucepan. Tip the biscuit crumbs into the
        butter and mix well until thoroughly combined. Press the buttery crumbs
        into the bottom of a 23cm/9in springform or loose-bottomed tin. Chill in
        the refrigerator while you make the topping.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine the cream cheese and mascarpone in a large mixing bowl. Using an
        electric handheld mixer, blend the cheeses together until light and
        fluffy. Add the icing sugar a little at a time and blend to incorporate.
        Finally, mix in the vanilla. The mixture should be very light and
        fluffy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the malted milk balls in the sealable freezer bag and close. Knock
        the malted milk balls with a rolling pin to just break them apart. Fold
        half of the crushed malted milk balls into the cream cheese mixture
        until thoroughly combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread the cream cheese mixture over the biscuit base and smooth the top
        with a palette knife or spatula. Cover with cling film and chill in the
        fridge for at least four hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        When ready to serve, sprinkle the remaining crushed malted milk balls
        over the top of the cheesecake. Release the catch of the springform tin
        carefully, then slice and serve.
